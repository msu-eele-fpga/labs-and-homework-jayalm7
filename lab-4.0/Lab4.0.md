# Lab 4.0 #

## Overview ##

designing a VHDL-based LED pattern controller

## Deliverables ##

create a system that controls various LED patterns based on switch inputs and handles asynchronous inputs. creating a top-level VHDL module, implementing state machines for pattern control, and a separate asynchronous conditioner for stable input handling.

### system architecture ###

main control unit, pattern generator, async conditioner, clock divider

### implementation details ###

creating a structured VHDL system to manage LED patterns efficiently. such as: state machine, clock divider etc.
